              <i>"My husband and I were so pleased with the care our dog, Arya, received from family-owned and operated Double Hydrant. Our concerns were put to rest allowing us to enjoy our vacation even more. Arya had a clean, safe place to sleep with access to the outside, fresh air. She went on walks and burned off energy running with the other guests in the fenced-in play yard. The staff is kind and friendly and the cost is affordable. We won't board anywhere else!"</i> - <b>Ryan and Rachel H.</b>

We were always in contact with the kennel and never had to worry. Fair pricing that included a bath before coming home was a great perk. We will definitely come back!
